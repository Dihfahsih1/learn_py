# Simple Function - Test Cases

The `simple()` function is designed to display the current date, time, and weekday in a specific format. The following test cases are created to verify the correctness of the function:

## Test Case 1: Verify date format
**Input:** No specific input required.
**Expected Output:** The output should display the current date in the format "Month Day, Year" (e.g., "June 7, 2023").

## Test Case 2: Verify time format
**Input:** No specific input required.
**Expected Output:** The output should display the current time in the format "Hour:Minute AM/PM" (e.g., "02:30 PM").

## Test Case 3: Verify weekday format
**Input:** No specific input required.
**Expected Output:** The output should display the current weekday as a three-letter abbreviation (e.g., "Mon", "Tue", "Wed").

## Test Case 4: Verify output consistency
**Input:** No specific input required.
**Expected Output:** The output of the `simple()` function should consistently produce the same results when called multiple times within a short time span.

## Test Case 5: Verify against a specific date
**Input:** Set the system clock to a specific date (e.g., June 1, 2023).
**Expected Output:** The output should match the expected date, time, and weekday for the specified date.

These test cases cover various aspects of the `simple()` function, including date format, time format, weekday format, consistency, and specific date verification. By executing these test cases, you can ensure the correctness and reliability of the function.
